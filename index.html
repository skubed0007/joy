            <h1 style="font-size: 4em;">Hi, I'm Jaytirth Kundan, but you can call me Joy<br><br></h1>
            <p style="font-size: 2em;">I'm a passionate programmer from India. I’m 16 years old, and my birthday is on
                July 5th. I’ve always
                been fascinated by technology, which led me to explore software development. My passion for coding
                drives me to constantly learn, experiment, and develop solutions that not only work but are efficient
                and user-friendly.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 2em;">I specialize in building tools and applications that make a difference, from
                programming languages to
                game engines, and much more. My journey has only just begun, and I’m always excited to take on new
                challenges. </p>

            <p class="project-description">Here are a few projects I’ve worked on:</p>

                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Neit</h3>
                    <p>Neit is a high-level, simple, and easy-to-use compiled programming language. Originally
                        started as a better way to write C, it has evolved into a language aimed at making
                        development faster and more efficient. The goal of Neit is to simplify syntax while
                        maintaining the power and flexibility required for complex programming tasks. It’s written in
                        Rust for speed and reliability. <br> <br> Find it on GitHub: <a
                            href="https://github.com/oxumlabs/neit" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Clua</h3>
                    <p>Clua is a Lua compiler that aims to integrate built-in features for enhanced ease of use. It
                        is designed to make Lua programming simpler and more efficient. Clua is still under heavy
                        development and is not ready to use yet It’s
                        built using Rust for performance. <br> <br> Find it on GitHub: <a

                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Cutils</h3>
                    <p>Cutils is a project focused on creating a simplified, more efficient version of
                        coreutils. It’s a coreutils rewrite, designed to make the command-line experience faster and
                        more intuitive. While it won’t replace the original coreutils, it aims to offer an optimized
                        alternative. The project is written in C, but I plan to transition it to Rust for better
                        memory safety and performance. <br> <br> Find it on GitHub: <a

                    <h3>CProjMaker</h3>
                    <p>CProjMaker is a tool that helps developers create C++ projects easily and quickly. It’s a
                        straightforward project maker for C++, currently in a basic form. I have plans to overhaul and
                        rewrite the tool, with the intention to shift the development to Rust to improve performance
                        and add new features. <br> <br> Find it on GitHub: <a

                    <h3>SOON TO PUT GAMES</h3>
                    <p>I'm working on several games that will be showcased here soon! While I currently have no live
                        games to display (I had previously uploaded games to itch.io but removed them), I am
                        planning to develop new titles that will be made available in the near future. Stay tuned for
                        some fun projects coming soon! </p>
